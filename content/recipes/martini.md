This is a "traditional" Martini with a greater amount of vermouth than is common today. Decrease the vermouth as you see fit. Make sure the drink and glass are _cold_.

## Ingredients

- 60 ml gin
- 30 ml dry vermouth
- 2 dashes orange bitters
- _(garnish)_ lemon twist or olives

## Instructions

Stir ingredients over ice. Serve in a cocktail glass. Garnish.
