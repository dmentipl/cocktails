Hi, I'm [Daniel Mentiplay](https://danielmentiplay.com). I love making cocktails. This is where I keep my collection of cocktail recipes to share with family, friends, and others.

Note that for cocktail recipes I prefer a slightly drier drink than seems to be common (adjust according to your taste), and I use rich sugar syrup which is 2:1 sugar-to-water by volume, as opposed to simple syrup which is 1:1.

Here is a list of bartenders and cocktail guides:
